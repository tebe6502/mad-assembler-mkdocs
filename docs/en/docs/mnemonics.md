## Available 65816 Instructions

Naturally, 6502 instructions are available, along with the following:

```none

MVP   PEA   PHB   PHD   PHK   PHX   PHY   PLB

```

## Mnemonic Extensions

It is possible to use **XASM**-style mnemonic extensions `a:`, `z:`, and `r:`, e.g.:

```
XASM        MADS
lda a:0     lda.a 0
ldx z:0     lda.z 0

org r:$40   org $40,*
```

It is possible to use a mnemonic extension after a dot `.` for instructions like `LDA`, `LDX`, `LDY`, `STA`, `STX`, and `STY`:

```
.b or .z          BYTE
.a or .w or .q    WORD
.t or .l          TRIPLE, LONG (24bit)
```

e.g.

```
lda.w #$00   ; A9 00 00
lda   #$80   ; A9 80
stx.w $f2    ; 8E F2 00
```

Exceptions are the following instructions, where the register size cannot be changed in absolute addressing (some assemblers do not require the `#` character for these instructions, but **MADS** does):

* `#$xx` for `SEP` `REP` `COP`

* `#$xxxx` for `PEA`

Another exception is the long indirect addressing mode, represented by square brackets `[]`. As we know, these brackets are also used for evaluating expressions; however, if the assembler encounters a `[` character first, it will treat it as long indirect addressing mode. If we haven't signaled the intention to use *65816*, an **Illegal addressing mode** error will occur. To "trick" the assembler, simply place a `+` sign before the opening square bracket `[`:

```
lda [2+4]     ; lda [6]
lda +[2+4]    ; lda 6
```
